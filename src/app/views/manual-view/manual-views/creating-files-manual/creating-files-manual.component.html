	You can create project files in one of 1 ways:<br>
	You can click on create "New Project" in the startup view or

	Clicking either button will prompt you to enter a name for your project. This will create a folder
	in the directory you specified and inside that folder will be a file called "my-project-name.vls"
	where VLS stands for "Video Live Set".
